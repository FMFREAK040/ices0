0.4.10  2019-09-19, moonbase
        * Allow specifying a username different from "source": '-U user' on
          commandline, <Username>user</Username> in ices.conf,
          Stream/Server section(s).
0.4.9   2019-09-16, moonbase
        * Re-introduce cue file writing upon request: '-Q' on commandline,
          <CueFile>1</CueFile> in ices.conf, Execution section.
0.4.8   2019-09-15, moonbase
        * Fix segfault/hang when directory or device was given as file path
          (instead of a regular playable file)
0.4.7   2019-08-23, moonbase
        * Fixed no FLAC metadata read bug if FLAC API 8+ was used. Closes #1.
0.4.6   2019-07-30, moonbase
        * Now works with both newer/older FLAC APIs
        * Fixed MP4/AAC support to work with libmp4v2
        * Added MP4 ReplayGain support (reads "----:com.apple.iTunes;replaygain_track_gain")
0.4.5   2019-05-23, moonbase
        * ReplayGain support added (replaygain_track_gain & RVA2 frames)
        * support for M3U/M3U8 playlist files (ignore lines starting with #)
          M3U/M3U8 files should be saved WITHOUT a BOM
        * Stream metadata now always UTF-8 (standard in FLAC and OGG,
          MP3 ID3v1+ID3v2 now transcoded, assuming ISO-8859-1 for ID3v1;
          This allows correct Artist - Title display even for mixed
          playlists.)
          Note: Newer Icecast servers assume ISO-8859-1 for MP3 mounts,
          so you might need <charset>UTF8</charset> as a mount param
          in your icecast.xml!
0.4.4   2019-04-11, moonbase
        * adapt to new FLAC API (now works with libflac 1.3.0 instead
          of requiring the older 1.1.2 to compile)
        * fixed FLAC/OGG artist and title bug (corrupted stream title
          when tags like "artistsort" and/or "titlesort" present).
0.4.3   2013-08-16, sblinch
        * fixed child reaping issue that caused huge numbers of zombies when
          using script-based playlists
        * removed cue file for reduced disk I/O
0.4.2	2012-06-24, sblinch
	* added MinCrossfade setting to specify a minimum track length for
	  which to enable the crossfader
	* added CrossMix option to crossmix tracks at 100% volume (instead
	  of fading) by Daniel Pettersson and Rolf Johansson
	* script pm: now supports accepting playback time limits from scripts
	* script pm: relative script paths are now treated as relative to the
	  ices binary path rather than an arbitrary compile-time module path
	* script pm: non-filename output from scripts is now better handled
	* added ices_log_error_output() to write error messages directly to the
	  logfile when possible rather than just storing them
	* added typecasting to correct dozens of compiler warnings
	* fixed double-free in script pm during empty-filename scenarios
0.4.1	2007-08-12
	* support for Unicode id3v2 tags (aka the infamous "garbage in
	  song titles" bug) - sblinch
	* script module ported from ices 2 by Ville Koskinen.
0.4     2004-08-28
	* FLAC transcoding support.
	* MP4 transcoding support added via libfaad.
	* Crossfader added.
	* Tested with LAME 3.96.1
0.3     2003-07-13
	* Updated to libshout2, which brings icecast2 compatibility.
	* ices will now attempt to trim junk and short frames from MP3 files,
	  which should help if you've been hearing chirps between songs.
	* Reencoding is much more reliable - VBR, sampling rate changes, and
	  a wide variety of bitrates have been tested.
	* Stability stability stability.
	* Ogg reencoding works on bigendian (eg PowerPC) systems now.
	* Mono reencoding bug fixed.
	* ID3v2 tag support.
	* A blank line in a playlist will terminate ices.
	* -i (icy_compat) has been removed in favor of -t 'protocol'
0.2.3	2002-05-01
	As always, the longer the time between releases, the less changed:
	* ices no longer uses threads, making it much leaner and more portable.
	* bundled with libshout 1.0.9, which makes it much less likely to
	  segfault on normal MP3 files.
	* Will now attempt to reload playlist modules when sighup'd. Make your
	  scripting changes without interrupting your stream.
	* Still includes a number of bugs (see BUGS)
0.2.2	2001-08-01
	* You can now specify the host and port for each mount point
	  separately. In fact, you have to.
	* MP3 encoding output buffer size increased, seems to handle VBRs
	  better, don't know why this is necessary at the moment.
	* Thread stack size increased again.
	* Write to stdout directly for usage/-V info, so it doesn't get
	  swallowed if ices is configured to run in the background.
	* Include system configuration info in ices -V output.
	* Use setsid() to detach from tty, not setpgid().
	* Load perl module as a proper module. This means you'd better return
	  1 at the end of your module.
	* Set PYTHONPATH reliably (not using an automatic variable), and
	  removed the arbitrary length limit.
	* Log file no longer appends PID. In general I think this is a silly
	  practice. I would have removed it from the cue file too, but a)
	  I don't use the cue file, and b) it at least cleans up after itself
	  on exit.
	* Build dependency bugs fixed.
0.2.1	2001-07-12
	* Thread stack size increased, to prevent segfaults during metadata
	  updates on Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and probably anything that
	  isn't Linux.
	* Sleep code fixed to work better on other platforms. Solaris users
	  should be happy.
	* All playlist functions but ices_get_next made optional.
	* Compatibility code uses old ices_(perl|python)_... function names
	  if new, documented (man 1 ices) functions aren't found.
0.2	2001-06-29
	* This is a development release. It is not guaranteed to be as stable
	  as 0.1.
	* Multiple streams are supported. Add multiple stream sections to
	  ices.conf or use multiple -m options on the command line. See the
	  man page for details.
	* Oh yeah, there's a man page.
	* ices can decode ogg vorbis files and reencode them as MP3
	* New ices_get_metadata function added for playlist scripts.
	* Better recovery from transient network problems.
	* SIGUSR1 causes ices to jump to the next track
0.1.0	2001-06-15
	* Reencoder updated to new LAME API of 3.88.
	* new option --with-xmlconfig when building to locate xml libraries
	* configure looks for python 2
	* new commandline option -V for version/feature info
	* cue file song length field now correct
	* BaseDirectory configuration option works
	* support for using an installed libshout
	* fixes to metadata update (first song metadata now set)
0.0.1b5	2000-08-29
	* Perl module now supports dynamic loading of modules (e.g "use Socket")
	* Ices now exits after 10 consecutive filename or other errors. (Removes spamming problems)
0.0.1b4	2000-08-24
	* New options to change sample rate and number of channels
	  when reencoding.
0.0.1b3	2000-08-08
	* Reencoding fixes, commented config file and README.playlist
	* Changed perl module to use user specified module
	* ices.py and ices.pm now commented
	* Configure.in now checks for gmake, and tells user to use this
	  if found.
	* ices.pm,ices.py and README.playlist included in dist.
	* Moved README to README.old and lynx -dump -nolist on
	  doc/icesmanual.html to the new README. (I don't want to
	  maintain two sets of documentation)
	* Started to work on the FAQ
0.0.1b2	2000-08-02
	* Code cleanup, lots of code comments added
0.0.1b1	2000-07-19
	* first release
